Welcome to the Accommodation Management System! This system helps you manage tenant information, tenancy details, accommodation availability, and payments. Let's dive into the story of how these tables work together to streamline the accommodation management process.

## Tenant Table

The **Tenant Table** serves as the foundation of our system. It stores essential information about our tenants, such as their names, dates of birth, contact details, and addresses. Each tenant is assigned a unique **Tenant ID** to ensure accurate identification.

## Tenancy Table

As tenants book accommodations, their tenancy details are recorded in the **Tenancy Table**. This table links the tenants from the **Tenant Table** to their respective accommodations. We track the check-in and check-out dates, the number of people accommodated (**Sleeps**), and the type of venue they choose (**Venue Type**).

## Accommodation Table

To maintain a comprehensive view of each tenant's accommodations, we connect the **Tenant Table** and the **Tenancy Table** through the **Accommodation Table**. This table holds the unique identifiers for both the tenants and the accommodations.

### Hall Table and Apartments Table

Depending on the type of accommodation, we have two additional tables. The **Hall Table** manages availability for our halls, catering to various events like weddings, birthdays, parties, and more. On the other hand, the **Apartments Table** handles the availability of our apartments, specifying check-in and check-out dates, the number of guests, rooms, and the option to check availability.

## Payments

To ensure seamless and secure transactions, we have the **Payments Table**. This table connects with the **Tenant Table** using the **Tenant ID**. Here, we store the tenant's payment details, including their full name, postal code, email address, contact details, billing address, payment method, and the option to add new cards. Additionally, tenants have the option to donate to charity through our system. The **Subtotal** and **Order Total** fields provide a clear overview of the payment details.

## Business or Owner Name

Finally, we have the **Business or Owner Name Table**. This table connects with the **Accommodation Table** and stores the details of the business or owner associated with each accommodation. It includes their name, business name, address, email address, and VAT information.

That wraps up our story of the Accommodation Management System and the interconnected tables within it. With this system in place, you can efficiently manage tenant information, tenancy details, accommodation availability, and payments. Enjoy using the system, and feel free to explore further!
